# Autonomous Agent README

This PHP code defines a template for an Autonomous Agent class that can perform tasks based on objectives using a Language Model. Here's a brief overview of the code:

## Overview

The Autonomous Agent is designed to perform tasks by generating a list of tasks based on a given objective and executing them. It leverages a Language Model (LLM) to generate tasks related to the specified objective. The agent stores information in its memory as it completes tasks and allows you to retrieve this information.

## Class Structure

The `AutonomousAgent` class consists of the following key methods and properties:

### Properties

- `$taskList`: An array to store tasks.
- `$memory`: An array to store information or results.

### Methods

- `addTask($task)`: Adds a task to the agent's task list.
- `setObjectiveAndGenerateTasks($llm, $objective)`: Sets an objective and generates tasks based on it using the provided Language Model.
- `executeTasks()`: Executes tasks in the task list. You can customize the task execution logic within this method.
- `retrieveInformation()`: Retrieves information or results from the agent's memory.

## Usage

   ```php
   $agent = new AutonomousAgent();
   $llm = new YourLLM();
   $objective = "Generate a report on AI advancements.";
   $agent->setObjectiveAndGenerateTasks($llm, $objective);
   $agent->executeTasks();
   $information = $agent->retrieveInformation();
   foreach ($information as $result) {
        echo $result . "\n";
    }
